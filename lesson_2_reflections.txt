Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository you're putting a .git file into your directory.
This lets you run git status on your directory to see what files have been 
changed.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offer?

The staging area is where you put files that you'd like to commit. It's
different from the working directory because files don't stay there, they're
just there temporarily. The value it offers is that it helps you pare 
out what's important from the working directory and the repository.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

You can use the git diff and the git diff --staged commands to compare what changes have
been made.
