Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work separate?

The benefit of doing this is that it allows you to collaborate with other people and have 
access to your work from any computer. 

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You don't want your changes pulled before you're ready to have them visible publicly.
